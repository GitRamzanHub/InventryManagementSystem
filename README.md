# InventryManagementSystem

**Project Description:**

The Inventory Management System is a robust application built using the Spring Framework and Spring Security to efficiently manage and track inventory across different ports or locations. This system offers several key features to streamline inventory control and ensure data security through authentication and authorization mechanisms.

**Key Features:**

**1. Inventory Update Across Ports:**

This system allows users to update inventory levels stored at different ports or locations seamlessly. Users can specify the port and the quantity to update, ensuring accurate stock data management.

**2. Incoming Stock Management:**

Incoming stock can be easily added to the system. When new stock arrives at a specific port, users can input the details, including the product name, quantity, and port. This feature helps in keeping the inventory database up-to-date.

**3. Outgoing Stock Management:**

After outgoing stock transactions, users can update the system to reflect the changes accurately. This ensures that the inventory levels are adjusted after sales or shipments, maintaining real-time data accuracy.

**4. Port-Based Stock Management:**

Users can manage inventory based on the port or location where the stock is added. This allows for efficient organization and tracking of stock across different geographical locations or storage areas.

**5. Spring Security Integration:**

**Authentication:** The system implements authentication, ensuring that only authorized users can access the application. Users must provide valid credentials (e.g., username and password) to log in.

**Authorization:** Spring Security's authorization features are leveraged to control access to specific parts of the application. Different user roles (e.g., admin, manager, staff) may have different levels of access and permissions. For example, administrators can perform inventory updates, while staff may only be able to view stock levels.

**Password Encryption:** Passwords are securely stored using encryption techniques to safeguard user credentials.

**Session Management:** Spring Security manages user sessions, ensuring that sessions are secure and automatically terminated after a defined period of inactivity.

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** The system employs role-based access control, allowing administrators to assign roles and permissions to users based on their responsibilities within the organization.

**Logout Functionality:** Users can securely log out of their accounts to prevent unauthorized access.

**Additional Features:**

**Logging:** The system may include logging functionality to track changes and activities within the application for audit and troubleshooting purposes.

**Reporting:** Depending on requirements, the system can generate reports on stock levels, transaction history, and other relevant data to aid in decision-making.

**Notifications:** Email notifications or alerts may be implemented to inform users about critical events, such as low stock levels or successful transactions.

**Conclusion:**

The Inventory Management System, built using the Spring Framework and Spring Security, offers a comprehensive solution for managing inventory efficiently, ensuring data security through robust authentication and authorization mechanisms. It facilitates real-time updates of inventory levels, simplifies incoming and outgoing stock management, and allows users to organize and track stock based on different ports or locations. Spring Security enhances data security by controlling user access and ensuring that only authorized personnel can perform critical operations within the system.
